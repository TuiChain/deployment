# TuiChain: Deployment

This repository contains scripts to deploy the TuiChain application:

- `dev-ganache.bash` - Runs a development web server locally with a SQLite database, and uses a local Ganache Ethereum test network. (You probably want to use this one.)
- `dev-testnet.bash` - Runs a development web server locally with a SQLite database, and uses a public Ethereum test network through Infura.

Run a script without any arguments for more information.

## Dependencies

- You must have Python 3.8 or higher and `npm` 6 or 7 installed.
- On Debian/Ubuntu you probably also need: `sudo apt-get install python3-dev`
